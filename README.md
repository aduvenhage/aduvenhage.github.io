## About
Programming is awesome!  I started with C++ while still at school.  Discovered star-fields and doom fire in sweet 320x240.  Was inspired by the PC demoscene, created my own graphics demos for school events and really wanted to make game engines.

Went on to study engineering.  Became interested in AI, 3D graphics and aircraft flight dynamics.   Created an air-to-air combat flight simulator as my final year engineering project for completion of my degree.

Got a research and development job at South Africa’s leading research institute and worked in the area of real-time modelling and simulation.  Worked on simulation models for aircraft, missiles, air-defence guns, RADARs and command and control systems.  Worked on 3D viewers and simulation based decision support tools.

Led the development of an in-house high-performance distributed real-time simulation framework, using C++.  Extended this framework to integrate with a whole range of military systems to support live training exercises and field trials.  Ran with all of this for about 10 years and helped many others to make use of the framework too.

Moved on to the earth observation and remote sensing domain as a Principle Engineer, working on vessel tracking and analysis.  Enjoyed creating a high performance web-socket backend for realtime vessel data (using C++) — creating a whole web-server and data integration framework in the process.  Used this a part of a vessel tracking system for the South African government.

Left the research institute and joined Takealot, South Africa’s largest online retailer, as a Senior Python Engineer.  Currently working in the Supply Chain team, developing and maintaining micro-service based systems (using Python, Kafka and Kubernetes).  

I like working in teams that deliver complex high performance systems!

# Lost & Found
Currently by day I'm a python web and micro-services backend programmer, but I have been coding in C++ for a long long long time. Remember 'Second Reality' by Future Crew? That was awesome. After seeing that I made some colourful patterns, fire and starfields in sweet 320x240 and I was hooked!!  I started some projects in an effort to stir up some ghosts and get back to what really made me want to be a programmer in the first place# Raytracer
