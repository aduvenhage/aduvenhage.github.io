## About
Programming is awesome!  I started with C++ while still at school.  Discovered star-fields and doom fire in sweet 320x240.  Was inspired by the PC demoscene, created my own graphics demos for school events and really wanted to make game engines.

Went on to study engineering.  Became interested in AI and pathfinding, 3D graphics and aircraft flight dynamics.  Created an air-to-air combat flight simulator as my final year engineering project.
Got a research and development job at South Africa’s leading research institute and worked in the area of real-time modelling and simulation.  Worked on models for aircraft, missiles, air-defence guns, RADARs and command and control systems.  Worked on 3D viewers and simulation based decision support tools.

Led the development of an in-house high-performance distributed real-time simulation framework, using C++.  Extended this framework to integrate with a whole range of military systems to support live training exercises and field trials.  Ran with all of this for about 10 years and helped many others to make use the framework too.

Moved on to the earth observation and remote sensing domain as a Principle Engineer, working on vessel tracking and analysis.  Enjoyed creating a high performance web-socket backend for realtime vessel data (using C++) — creating a whole web-server and data integration framework in the process.  Used this a part of a vessel tracking system for the South African government.  Also led the development of other web-based systems (using Python).

Left the research institute and joined Takealot, South Africa’s largest online retailer, as a Senior Python Engineer.  Currently working in the Supply Chain team, developing and maintaining micro-service based systems (using Python, Kafka and Kubernetes).

I like working in teams that deliver complex high performance systems.
