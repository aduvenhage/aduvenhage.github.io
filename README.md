## About
I have been programming for a very long time.  Started with C++ while still at school: Discovered star-fields and doom fire in sweet 320x240.  Really wanted to make game engines, got inspired by 64K demos and did some graphics demos for school events.
  
Went on to study engineering: got interested in AI and pathfinding, and got very interested in 3D graphics and aircraft flight dynamics.  Created an air-to-air combat flight simulator as my final engineering project.
Got a research and development job at South Africa’s leading research institute and worked in the area of real-time modelling and simulation.  Worked on models for aircraft, missiles, air-defence guns, RADARs and command and control systems.  Worked on 3D viewers and simulation based decision support tools.
Led the development of an in-house distributed modelling and simulation framework, using C++.  Extended this framework to integrate with a whole range of military systems to support live training exercises and field trials.  Kept on with all of this for about 10 years and collected it all into a very well received masters dissertation.

Still at the research institute, moved on to the earth observation and remote sensing domain as a Principle Engineer, working on vessel tracking and analysis.  Enjoyed creating a high performance web-socket based mapping backend for realtime vessel data (using C++ and docker).  Ended up creating a whole web-server and data integration framework used to develop part of a vessel tracking system for the South African government.  Also led the development of other web based systems (using Python and DJANGO).

Left the research institute and joined Takealot, South Africa’s biggest online retailer, as a Senior Python Engineer.  Currently working in the Supply Chain team, developing and maintaining micro-service based systems (using Python, Kafka and Kubernetes).
